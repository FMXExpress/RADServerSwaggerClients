RAD Server v10.3.1 Swagger CodeGen Clients

Generated clients from http://editor.swagger.io/ using the default RAD Server 10.3.1 /api/apidoc.json file.

I tried some of these clients (bash, powershell, csharp) and it seems like some of them have syntax issues with the generated code. Should be fixable. If you use a client and fix the code be sure to issue a patch back up to this repo so we can all benefit.
